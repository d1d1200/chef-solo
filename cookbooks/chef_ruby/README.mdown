# chef_ruby

Installs Ruby 2.1.x from source.


## Acknowledgements

RVM in conjunction with Chef is shit.


## Cookbook Requirements

* apt
* build-essential


## Attributes

* `default[:chef_ruby][:version] = "2.1.4p265"`: string containing the ruby version you want to install.
* `default[:chef_ruby][:rubygems][:version] = "2.2.2"`: string containing the rubygems version you want to install.
* `default[:chef_ruby][:user] = "ubuntu"`: string containing the user run as.


## Recipes

* `default`: installs Ruby from source.


## Usage
When setting up a system for the first time, Ohai will profile it and then store the ruby directory as `/opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby`.
This attribute (normally referenced in cookbooks as `languages[:ruby][:gems_dir]`) does not get reset automatically when a new Ruby is
installed. The default recipe tells Ohai to reload its attributes. Adding this block to any recipe that uses the attribute `languages[:ruby][:gems_dir]`;
then, whenever Ohai reloads its attributes, your cookbook will also reload its attributes.

```ruby
ruby_block "reload_ruby" do
  block do
    node.load_attribute_by_short_filename('<filename of attributes, eg default>', '<name of cookbook that contains the attributes>')
  end

  action :nothing
  subscribes :create, "ohai[reload]", :immediately
end
```
